                            <h4>Web Design</h4>
                            <p>I have worked as a professional web designer for more than 3 years. Making eye-catching website designs and putting them into practice with front-end programming is my passion. I take pride in keeping up with contemporary design trends and using my imagination to create aesthetically pleasing and intuitive websites. I have gained a thorough understanding of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) principles over the course of my career. I conduct extensive study and analysis before beginning a new project.</p>

                            <h4>Front-end Development</h4>
                            <p>If you have any interesting information, a website is the best way to see if you have a great idea. Because of this, I am aware that I have spent the last two years using HTML5, CSS, CSS animation, JavaScript, JavaScript library, and jQuery because javaScript has become essential for front-end development. Additionally, frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js have further solidified its importance in modern web development. I've worked on a lot of projects over the last two years and have learned a lot about what I do.</p>

                            <h4>Back-end Development</h4>
                            <p>In the last two years, I've been focusing on back-end programming with PHP and have been customizing WordPress themes quite effectively. Over the past year, I've also begun working on Laravel projects, which has significantly improved my skills and deepened my understanding of modern web development practices. Additionally, I've noticed that frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js have become essential tools in this field, further emphasizing the importance of staying updated with the latest technologies.</p>

                            <h4>Apps Development</h4>
                            <p>I've been working with React.js using Vite for application development, which has streamlined my workflow significantly. Vite's hot module replacement feature makes it easy to see changes in real-time, enhancing the development experience. For database purposes, I'm using MongoDB, which provides a flexible and scalable solution for handling data in my projects. Combining React with Vite and MongoDB has allowed me to build efficient and dynamic web applications that can handle various user interactions and data storage needs effectively.</p>
